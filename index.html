Hi my name is Guillermo. And belive it or not you're reading a couple of bytes from a machine located some place in The Planet Earth. If you're reading this you're either a surviber of an electromagnetic pulse from the sun or it hasn't come yet since the cretion of the internet. Maybe you just escaped from Planet Earth.
